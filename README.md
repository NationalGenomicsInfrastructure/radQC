# remiolsen/radqc

## Introduction

**remiolsen/radqc** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline for Pipeline for QC of RAD-seq data.

## Documentation

Please see the more detailed [usage documentation](docs/README.md)

## Quick start

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

To test your nextflow / Docker / Singularity setup on your computer you can run the pipeline using test data:

```
nextflow run remiolsen/radQC -profile <docker,singularity>,test -r master
```

When you this test run is successfully completed, or if you elect to skip it you can start your analysis run. First by preparing a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,population,fastq_1,fastq_2
sample101,pop1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run remiolsen/radqc \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --enzyme <enzyme> \
   --outdir <OUTDIR> \
   -r <master,v##.##>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).
